0. Before installing, make sure you have PHP 5.6 and above installed. PHP 7.0+ is highly recommended.
1. Upload the content of `src` to your server, or extract them on your PC.
2. Import the content of `setup.sql` into your database. In later versions, I'll add an automatic SQL importer.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/project-manager/list` to open the app.

At the moment, you can access the `list` and the `edit` page by typing the URLS:
- `http://localhost/project-manager/list`
- `http://localhost/project-manager/edit`

In the future, I'll add a navigation bar.
