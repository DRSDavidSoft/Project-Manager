  A nice logo and a cool name is also required.

- Help regarding seperating the view from the code and implementing an Ajax style page is needed.
  I'm open for suggestions regarding a JS framework which we all would agree on.
  
  (Also keep in mind that this app needs to be supported and properly functional on mobile.)
