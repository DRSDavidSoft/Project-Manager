Please before contributing, read the following:
0. Since the project was written mostly as a hobby and was just a proof of concept for me,
   I didn't really think of making it open-source, and I certainly didn't think that I should
   comment it or use OOC instead of the plain old procedural coding.
   
   This means that *almost* all of the project files need to be re-written, with the help of you guys.
   
1. The `core` folder includes the helpers and wrappers which I had coded for my personal use, and is
   shared with my other projects. I'm currently re-writing them out of the spaghetti code and more into
   a nice OO one, so please ignore them at the moment.
   
2. As I said, I'm working on re-writing the main logic behind the project, so I'd rather if you start using
   it and post the issues and suggested improvements before making pull requests.
   
   For now, almost all of the MVC is in the `pages` directory. I have to separate view from controller and the
   model, and draw a logic for each page.
   
   After each part of the code is placed in the correct directory, all pull requests are welcome.
   (I think that'll give you a bit of time to explore the project before contributing to it.)
   
3. Discussions for improvements and feature requests should go to the issues page.
   Once we're certain on which features to implement, they should be prioritized and placed 
   in the `TODO.md` file.
   
Please keep reading the `TODO.md` file for more information.
