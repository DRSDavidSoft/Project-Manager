This project is currently at the beta stage, almost all of the files need to be re-written.
* For the guide regarding the installation, please read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
* Before any contribution, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage:
This part will be documented later, but for now it's like this:
1. The `list` page will provide a list of all of the open tasks, which link to the edit page.
2. The `edit` page is used for both editing tasks with a given ID, and for creating new tasks.
3. More pages will be listed here as I finish writing the code and commit them here.
