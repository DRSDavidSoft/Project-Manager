Add your current tasks and organize them.

A Project Management app to help organize, prioritize and store details and resources about your projects and TODOs.

This project is currently at the beta stage, almost all of the files need to be re-written.
* For the guide regarding the installation, please read [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
* Before any contribution, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Usage:
This part will be documented later, but for now it's like this:
1. The `list` page will provide a list of all of the open tasks, which link to the edit page.
2. The `edit` page is used for both editing tasks with a given ID, and for creating new tasks.
3. More pages will be listed here as I finish writing the code and commit them here.
